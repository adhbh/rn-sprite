# rn-sprite

rn-sprite is a react native component for creating `animations` from `spritesheets` for IOS and Android devices


##### ...Spritesheets? ...Animations?
A `sprite` is a single graphic image that is incorporated into a larger scene so that it appears to be part of the scene.
When you put many sprites into a single image, you get a `spritesheet` like [this][h-sprite] and [this][v-sprite].
The process of changing images in quick succession to give the illusion of movement is called `animation`.

Code:

```js
<Sprite
	sequence={[ 
			0.04, 
			0.125, 0.20815, 0.2913, 0.37445, 0.4576, 
			0.54075, 0.6239, 0.70705, 0.7902, 0.87335, 0.9565,
			0.04,
	]}
	move="vertical"
	loop
	fps={10}
	isPlaying
	source="https://github.com/adhbh/rn-sprite/raw/master/vertical.jpg"
	width={windowWidth}
	height={windowHeight / 2}
	onTouchStart={() => true}
	onTouchMove={() => true}
	onTouchEnd={() => true}
/>
```

  - Works on IOS and Android
  - Supports [horizontal][h-sprite], [vertical][v-sprite] and grid spritesheets
  - Play/Pause support
  - Configurable animation speed
  - Touch responsive
