# rn-sprite

rn-sprite is a react native component for creating `animations` from `spritesheets` for IOS and Android devices


##### ...Spritesheets? ...Animations?
A `sprite` is a single graphic image that is incorporated into a larger scene so that it appears to be part of the scene.
When you put many sprites into a single image, you get a `spritesheet` like [this][h-sprite] and [this][v-sprite].
The process of changing images in quick succession to give the illusion of movement is called `animation`.

Code:

```

<Sprite
  sequence =  { [0.04, 0.125, 0.20815, 0.2913, 0.37445, 0.4576, 0.54075, 0.6239, 0.70705, 0.7902, 0.87335, 0.9565, 0.04] }
  move = { 'vertical' }
  loop = { true }
  fps = { 10 }
  isPlaying = { true }
  source = { 'https://github.com/adhbh/rn-sprite/raw/master/vertical.jpg' }
  width = { windowWidth }
  height = { windowHeight/2 }
  onTouchStart = { () => true }
  onTouchMove = { () => true }
  onTouchEnd = { () => true } />

```

Android local images.
```
const resolveAssetSource = require("react-native/Libraries/Image/resolveAssetSource");

render (
  <Sprite
    sequence =  { [0.04, 0.125, 0.20815, 0.2913, 0.37445, 0.4576, 0.54075, 0.6239, 0.70705, 0.7902, 0.87335, 0.9565, 0.04] }
    source = { resolveAssetSource(require('./vertical.jpg')) }
    sourceWidth = { 4096 }  // required
    sourceHeight = { 4096 } // required
    />
);
```

  - Depends on [gl-react-native][gl-rn]
  - Works on IOS and Android
  - Supports both [horizontal][h-sprite] and [vertical][v-sprite] spritesheets
  - Play/Pause support
  - Configurable animation speed
  - Touch responsive
